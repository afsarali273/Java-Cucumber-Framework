---

### Wait Milliseconds
```gherkin
When wait for 500 milliseconds
When wait for 1000 milliseconds
```
**Use Case:** Precise timing for animations or transitions

---

## üí° Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Use explicit waits instead of hard waits (pause)
- Wait for specific conditions (visible, clickable, text)
- Use appropriate timeouts based on application behavior
- Wait for page load after navigation
- Wait for elements to disappear (loading indicators)

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Overuse `pause` - prefer condition-based waits
- Use very long timeouts (>30 seconds) without reason
- Wait for elements that are already present
- Chain multiple waits unnecessarily

---

## üéØ Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Wait for Page Load After Navigation
```gherkin
Given navigate to "https://example.com"
When wait for page load
Then element "#header" should be visible
```

---

### Pattern 2: Wait for Loading to Complete
```gherkin
When click element "#loadData"
And wait for element ".loading-spinner" to disappear for 20 seconds
Then element ".data-table" should be visible
```

---

### Pattern 3: Wait for Dynamic Content
```gherkin
When type "search term" into "#searchBox"
And wait for element count of ".result" to be 10 for 15 seconds
Then element ".result" should be visible
```

---

### Pattern 4: Wait for URL Change
```gherkin
When click element "#loginBtn"
And wait for URL to contain "dashboard" for 10 seconds
Then page title should contain "Dashboard"
```

---

### Pattern 5: Wait for Text Update
```gherkin
When click element "#refreshBtn"
And wait for text "Updated" to appear for 10 seconds
Then element ".status" should contain text "Updated"
```

---

### Pattern 6: Wait for Element State Change
```gherkin
When type "user@example.com" into "#email"
And wait for attribute "class" of "#email" to contain "valid" for 5 seconds
Then element "#submitBtn" should be enabled
```

|-----------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Condition-based** | ‚ö° Fast | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê High | Preferred |
| **Polling** | ‚ö° Fast | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Good | Dynamic content |
| **Hard wait (pause)** | üêå Slow | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Moderate | Last resort |

## üß™ Testing Examples

### Example 1: Login Flow
```gherkin
Feature: Login with Waits

  Scenario: Successful login with proper waits
    Given navigate to "https://example.com"
    When wait for page load
    And wait for element "#loginForm" to be present
    And type "testuser" into "#username"
    And type "password123" into "#password"
    And wait for element "#loginBtn" to be enabled
    And click element "#loginBtn"
    And wait for URL to contain "dashboard" for 10 seconds
    Then element ".welcome-message" should be visible
```

---

### Example 2: Search with Dynamic Results
```gherkin
Feature: Search with Dynamic Content

  Scenario: Search and wait for results
    Given navigate to "https://example.com/search"
    When type "automation" into "#searchBox"
    And wait for element ".loading" to disappear for 15 seconds
    And wait for element count of ".result" to be 10
    Then element ".result" should be visible
```

---

### Example 3: Form Validation
```gherkin
Feature: Form Validation

  Scenario: Wait for field validation
    Given navigate to "https://example.com/register"
    When type "invalid-email" into "#email"
    And wait for attribute "class" of "#email" to contain "error" for 5 seconds
    Then element ".error-message" should contain text "Invalid email"
```

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Element not found
**Solution:** Increase timeout or verify locator
```gherkin
# Before
When wait for visible "#button" for 5 seconds

# After
When wait for visible "#button" for 15 seconds
```

---

### Issue: Flaky tests due to timing
**Solution:** Use condition-based waits instead of pause
```gherkin
# ‚ùå Bad
When pause for 5 seconds
And click element "#button"

# ‚úÖ Good
When wait for clickable "#button" for 10 seconds
And click element "#button"
```

---

### Issue: Page not fully loaded
**Solution:** Add page load wait after navigation
```gherkin
Given navigate to "https://example.com"
When wait for page load
And wait for element "#content" to be present
```
