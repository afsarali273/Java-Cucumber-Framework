Feature: User Management API

  Background:

    When user saves json path "id" as "userId"
    And user saves json path "email" as "userEmail"

  Scenario: Get user by ID
    When user sends GET request to "/users/${userId}"
    Then response status code should be 200
    And json path "email" should be "${userEmail}"
    And json path "role" should be "admin"
    And response time should be less than 1000 ms

  Scenario: Update user

  Scenario: Search users with pagination
    When user sets query param "page" as "1"
    And user sets query param "limit" as "10"
    And user sends GET request to "/users" with query params
    Then response status code should be 200
    And json array "data" should have size 10
    And json path "pagination.page" should be 1

  Scenario: Validate user email format
    When user sends GET request to "/users/${userId}"
    Then json path "email" should match regex "^[\\w.-]+@[\\w.-]+\\.\\w+$"
    And json path "email" should be of type "string"

  Scenario: Delete user
    When user sends DELETE request to "/users/${userId}"

        <h2>Tips & Best Practices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>âœ… Use Background for common setup (headers, base URL)</li>
          <li>âœ… Save IDs and tokens to variables for reuse</li>
          <li>âœ… Validate status codes first, then response body</li>
          <li>âœ… Use json path for nested field validation</li>
          <li>âœ… Add response time assertions for performance</li>
          <li>âœ… Use regex for format validation (email, phone, etc.)</li>
          <li>âœ… Leverage service switching for microservices</li>
          <li>âœ… Use data tables for multiple similar requests</li>
          <li>âœ… Clear variables between independent scenarios</li>
          <li>âœ… Log responses for debugging</li>
